# FastAPI - HTMX Playground

Not much going on here at the moment.

There is basic auth, no JWT tokens or anything like that. Simple supabase auth with email/pass.

Stackerino:

- FastAPI
- HTMX
- Alpine.js (For some dynamic css behaviour for now)
- Hyperscript (Nothing in the code yet, just wanted to try it out)
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase

As you can see from the above stack. I like Locality of Behaviour.
